## Overview
StudentInsight is a machine learning project focused on predicting student academic performance based on various demographic, academic, and behavioral factors. Using data from the UCI Student Performance Dataset, this project explores different models to accurately predict final grades and helps in identifying key factors that influence student success.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between variables to gain insights.
- **Modeling:** Implementing and comparing different machine learning models, including Linear - Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regressor.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing models using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most influential features for predictive modeling.


### Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentInsight-AcademicPerformanceModeling.git
cd StudentInsight-AcademicPerformanceModeling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the data analysis, modeling, and evaluation:

```bash
jupyter notebook StudentInsight_Modeling.ipynb
```
This notebook guides you through the entire process, from data exploration to model evaluation.


### Results
- **Best Model:** Linear Regression
- **Performance Metrics on Test Set:**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.75
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.40
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.18
   - **R-squared (RÂ²):** 0.86
